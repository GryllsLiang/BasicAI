This is an assignment. 

In Ass1, we applied different algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search with Cycle-Check, Iterative-Deepening Search with Cycle-Check, Uniform-Cost Search, A* Search , Greedy Best-first Search
) to solve the maze problem.

In Ass2, we created a directed graph for nucleotide sequences, and applied simulated annealing algorithm, to find the (relatively) optimal path which connect all the sequences.
